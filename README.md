# Test-driven development (TDD)

This is an application that tests method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:

`````
When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
`````
